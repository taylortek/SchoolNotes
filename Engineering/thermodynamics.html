<ul>
<li>
Thermal Energy is kinetic energy in transit from one object to another due to tempature difference. (joules)

<li>
Tempature is the average kinetic energy of particles in an object; not the total amount of kinetic energy particles. (degrees)

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Matter is made up of molecules in motion (kinetic energy)

<li>
An increase in tempature increases motion

<li>
A decrease in tempature decreases motion

<li>
Absolute Zero occurs when all kinetic energy is removed from an object 0K=-273C

<div id="Thermal Energy (heat) Transfer"><h2 id="Thermal Energy (heat) Transfer" class="header"><a href="#Thermal Energy (heat) Transfer">Thermal Energy (heat) Transfer</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
The transfer or movement of thermal energy

<ul>
<li>
Most common types of transfer

<ol>
<li>
Convection

<ul>
<li>
The transfer of thermal energy by movement of fluid (liquid or gas)

</ul>
<li>
Conduction

<ul>
<li>
The transfer of thermal energy within an object or between objects from molecule to molecule

</ul>
<li>
Radiation

<ul>
<li>
The process by which energy is transmitted through a medium, including empty space, as electromagnetic waves

</ul>
</ol>
<li>
100% efficiency is unattainable

<li>
ALL processes are irreversible

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="1st Law of Thermodynamics"><h2 id="1st Law of Thermodynamics" class="header"><a href="#1st Law of Thermodynamics">1st Law of Thermodynamics</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Law of energy conservation applied to a thermal system

<ul>
<li>
Thermal energy can change form and location but cannot be created or destroyed.

<li>
Thermal energy can be increased within a system by adding thermal energy (heat) or by performing work in a system.

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="2nd Law of Thermodynamics"><h2 id="2nd Law of Thermodynamics" class="header"><a href="#2nd Law of Thermodynamics">2nd Law of Thermodynamics</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Thermal energy flows from hot to cold

<li>
Entropy is the measure of how evenly distributed heat is within a system.

<ul>
<li>
A system tends to go from order to disorder

<li>
The total amount of energy in the world does not change, but the availability of that energy constantly decreases.

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Thermodynamic Equilibrium"><h2 id="Thermodynamic Equilibrium" class="header"><a href="#Thermodynamic Equilibrium">Thermodynamic Equilibrium</a></h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
Thermal equilibrium is obtained when touching objects within a system reach the same tempature.

<li>
When thermal equilibrium is reached, the system loses its ability to do work.

<li>
Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics: if two systems are separately found to be in thermal equilibrium with a third system, the first two systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
